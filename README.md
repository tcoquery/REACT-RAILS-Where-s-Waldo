# Where's Waldo 

This was the final project of the REACT curriculum from The Odin Project.

The goal was to use React for the frontend and Rails as an api for the backend. 

The backend stores the coordinates for the characters of each puzzle. When the player clicks on the image, it checks the coordinates against the database to determine whether the player found a character.

When the player finds all characters, he can enter his name which is stored in the backend, along with his score.
